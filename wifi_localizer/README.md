# Wi-Fi Localization Project
This project contains a Python script for a Wi-Fi localization problem. The main script, `wifi_dist.py`, can be run using the IPython interpreter.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have Python and IPython installed on your system.
-   **Python 3.x** 
-   **IPython**: You can install it via pip:
    ```
    pip install ipython
    ```

## How to Run

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
    
2.  Navigate to the main project directory (`OptimalProblem`).
    
3.  Start the IPython interpreter by typing `ipython`.

        $ ipython

4.  Once in the IPython console, run the main script using the `%run` magic command. The `-i` flag keeps the interpreter in interactive mode after the script has finished executing.
    
        In [1]: %run -i ../wifi_localizer/wifi_dist.py
        

This will execute the script and leave you in the interactive IPython shell, allowing you to inspect variables and continue working with the script's environment.
